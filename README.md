# liri-node-app

This project allows you to retrieve information about specific songs searched and movies. Additionaly, it displays a maximum of your last 20 tweets from Twitter. 

This project is useful for learning node.js. 

You can get started by following the commands expressed in liri.js. Example: 

node liri.js my-tweets
node liri.js spotify-this-song Mrs. Officer 
nodde liri.js movie-this The Lion King

If you'd like help with this project, please refer to node documentation.

I maintain and contributed to this project.
